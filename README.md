# Maa Resonance Tauri Template

This is a project for creating a Maa Resonance front end with Tauri.

## Getting Started

WIP

Generally you need to have MaaFramework installed then run `makedeps.py` to correctly place the dynamic libraries for packaging.

The python script is only tested on Windows.
